## Homework

#### Requirements

- Fork this repository (use the "Fork" button in the upper right)
- Clone this repository to your computer
    * Click the green "Clone or Download" button and copy the https url for the repo
    * Use the cd command in your terminal to navigate to where you want to download the repo on your machine
    * Use the command "git clone <url>" where you replace <url> with the actual url you copied
- Open the starter code and modify Main.java to complete the code per instructions in the comments for problems 1 and 2a-c
- Save Main.java and tomorrow we'll learn how to submit via git and github

**Bonus:**
- Complete problem 3 per instructions in the comments in the starter code

#### Starter code

Open IntelliJ, click "Open" and select the `starter-code` folder in the repo you cloned to your machine

#### Deliverable

Tomorrow we'll learn how to _commit_ your code in git, then _push_ it to github, then finally submit a _pull request_ to submit your code to us. For now, just save your code and remember where it is :)
